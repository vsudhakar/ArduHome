General Readme Stuff

1) A lot of the code contained in this repository is based on tutorials found
on the internet, for this reason I do not want to take all of the credit for
this work and future revisions of the code contained here must be published
free for use and modication for others.

2) This code will not run without certain arduino and nodeJS libraries.
